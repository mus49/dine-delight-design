## 🔁 **SDLC Steps Taken**

### **1. Requirement Gathering & Analysis**

**Goal**: Understand user needs and define must-have features.

**Activities Done**:

- Brainstormed features and user goals based on similar apps (e.g., Zomato, Uber Eats).
    
- Created a list of core features: restaurant cards, food items, cart, smooth navigation.
    
- Researched color psychology for appetite stimulation (orange → hunger).
    
- Defined target audience: 18-35, tech-savvy, food lovers.
    

**Survey Input**:

> "What feature makes you stay on a food delivery app longer?"

- 52% said _“high-quality food photos”_
    
- 40% said _“easy to use interface”_
    
- 8% said _“theme and design aesthetics”_
    

**Why This Step?**  
Clear understanding of the audience and competitors helps tailor the experience for maximum engagement and usability.

---

### **2. Planning**

**Goal**: Define roadmap, resources, and risk mitigation strategies.

**Decisions Made**:

- Chose **React** for frontend due to component reusability.
    
- Used **Figma** for wireframing.
    
- Focused on **mobile-first** design.
    
- Estimated 4-week timeline with agile-style weekly milestones.
    

**Why This Step?**  
Helps avoid scope creep and ensures team alignment with goals and timeline.

### **3. Design**

**Goal**: Visually communicate the app’s purpose — to entice and ease.

**UI/UX Decisions**:

- Orange-themed buttons, highlights, and accents (hex #FF6F00).
    
- Big images of food using dummy assets (unsplash/pexels).
    
- Simple navigation tabs: Home, Cart, Checkout.
    
- Responsive design with accessible contrast levels.
    

**User Feedback**:

> "How appealing is this layout on a scale of 1–5?"  
> Average: **4.6/5**  
> "Which image style do you prefer?"

- 67% chose **zoomed-in, warm-toned photos**
    

**Why This Step?**  
Design creates the first impression. The goal was to **evoke hunger visually** while maintaining ease of use.

---

### **4. Development**

**Goal**: Implement the interface as designed.

**Implementation**:

- Used **React components** for each feature (e.g., `<RestaurantCard />`, `<Cart />`).
    
- Incorporated **hover animations** and image fade-ins using CSS/Framer Motion.
    
- Built a **dynamic cart system** with state management.
    
- **Lazy loading** for large images to improve performance.
    

**Why This Step?**  
Translating UI into functional components ensures real interaction and brings the design to life.

---

### **5. Testing**

**Goal**: Ensure interface looks and functions correctly.

**Types of Testing Done**:

- **Visual Testing**: Checked color consistency, responsive breakpoints
    
- **Functional Testing**: Add-to-cart flow, clear cart, update quantity
    
- **User Testing (Mock)**:
    
    > "Was the cart intuitive?" – 90% said yes  
    > "Were the images too large?" – 18% said yes, adjusted padding accordingly
    

**Why This Step?**  
Testing ensures a smooth experience and fixes usability issues before going live.

---

### **6. Deployment**

**Goal**: Make the app interface available for viewing/use.

**Actions Taken**:

- Deployed on **Vercel**.
    
- Linked custom domain (optional).
    
- Enabled performance monitoring (Lighthouse audit scores).
    

**Why This Step?**  
Live deployment is essential for feedback collection, presentation, or future integration with backend systems.

---

### **7. Maintenance**

**Goal**: Keep interface fresh and functional over time.

**Post-launch Tasks**:

- Optimized image sizes and loading.
    
- Updated visuals based on feedback (e.g., food tags for veg/non-veg).
    
- Added animations for hover and transitions.
    

**Why This Step?**  
Good UI is iterative. Updates based on feedback enhance user satisfaction.
